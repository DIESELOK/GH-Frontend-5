# GH-Frontend-5

A step by step guide on how to work with this Repo:

1. Make a fork of this repo: https://github.com/RuslanYurchenko/GH-Frontend-5
2. Clone your fork to you local machine using 'git clone' command
3. Create a new folder in that repo called 'LessonN' (where N is the number of lesson), 
   put your homeworks there and, as you finish with homeworks (and create needed commits, I suppose you know how to do that)
   do 'git push origin master'
4. In this repo click 'New pull request' and just follow those steps
   (all relations between fork and upstream are already configured, so don't change anything except title and comments).
   PLEASE ADD ME (dixalex) as a reviewer on that page. We'll be notified when you create a pull request.
